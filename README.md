DDSP-FM is a fork of the [official DDSP library](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp). This version includes the following new features:
* a differentiable 4-op FM synthesizer
* a differentiable AM synthesizer
* a new operator, `mult`
* a new TFRecord, suitable for future develpments, such as preset matching
* a flag for stopping the training if losses are NaN
